In cosmology, a class of functions is called Einstein-Boltzmann machines (EBM). These simulate the universe from the base cosmological parameters. While they have incredible accuracy, they are also slow. Their primary use is Markov chain Monte Carlo for parameter estimation, meaning they get called many times. The high number of calls and the slowness of calls are less than ideal; therefore, an ai emulator which can encode the outputs of the EBM could provide significant benefits. Data for this could be generated by the standard EBM, with stochastic gradient descent used to tune the model's parameters. As this is a high-precision use case, success would require deviation from the standard EBM output to be insignificant especially compared to the accuracy of experimental data's uncertainty.
